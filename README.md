Node.js Number Guessing Game

A simple command-line game where you guess a randomly generated number. Perfect for testing your luck and logic!

---

How It Works

- The game picks a random number between 1 and 100.
- You enter your guesses, and the program tells you if itâ€™s too high, too low, or correct.
- It tracks your attempts and lets you replay as many times as you want.
- Type `exit` to quit anytime.
